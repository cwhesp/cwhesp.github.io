# Preliminary:Building Platforms and Webtools

Building Platforms:  
[Linux System](www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/10-basic-linux-commands-that-every-linux-newbies-should-remember)  
Useful commands.

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/"Tensorflow")  
Open-source machine-learning platform. Dependent Language: Python [Free]

[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/"PyTorch")  
Succint and trouble-free building platform. Dependent Language: Python [Free]

[C++](http://www.mlpack.org/)  ML library written in C++. [Free]

[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/machine-learning.html) / [MatConNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)  
Using Matlab to build ML network.  [May be paid]

[Python-Tutorial](www.liaoxuefeng.com/"递归函数 - 廖雪峰的官方网站")  
A comprehensive website for python beginners.

Useful webtools:

[Github](https://github.com/) --[Github-Installation](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/install-git-and-github-on-ubuntu-14.04/)     [Github-Usage](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/06/git_remote.html)  
Amazing collaborate platform, and good place to store your code.

[Google VM](https://cloud.google.com/) --[VM-Setup](https://haroldsoh.com/2016/04/28/set-up-anaconda-ipython-tensorflow-julia-on-a-google-compute-engine-vm/) /[GUI Support](https://medium.com/google-cloud/graphical-user-interface-gui-for-google-compute-engine-instance-78fccda09e5c)  
Three hundred dollars worth of credits free to use. But GPU is not supported then.

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) --[Notepad++-Plugin](https://sites.google.com/site/fstellari/nppplugins"Autofill and Autosave")  
Free editing software with multi-functional hightlight.
